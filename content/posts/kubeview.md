On the past few months, I've been using `kubeview` for my trainings.
It allows me to show a graphic representation of my kubernetes infrastructure, allowing students to better understand what is happening under the different kubernetes components.

# Installation

To install `kubeview`, just deploy the manifests available on the [official repo.](https://github.com/benc-uk/kubeview/tree/master/deployments)

Once this is ready, open a new browser and point to your service instance. Instructions on how to perform this are available on the `kubeview` repository.

Now, let's try it :)

# Demo 1: Deploying an application

# Demo 2: Rolling upgrades

# Demo 3 : HPA Scaling up and down
