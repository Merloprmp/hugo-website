After some time without posting, I've decided to return with a lot of new and interesting things. Here are some updates :)

I've been cleaning up my digital footprints with the following tools:

- Blog:
  - I am leaving blogger and switching to `Hugo`. _Why_? I couldn't use the `.com.ar` domain due to the Argentinian burocracy to renew it, and the migration to the `.me` domain wasn't as straightforward as I was hoping. ~~The previous blog is still available on [https://blog.cristianmarquez.me](https://blog.cristianmarquez.me)~~ __Update__: I've migrated all the previous posts in `hugo`. The previous subdomain doesn't exist anymore.

- Facebook:
  - Archiving/Deleting messages: I found a very nice `gist` to archive and delete facebook messages. It's available on [github](https://gist.github.com/tedmiston/c7ac401da96b55022aaf) and only requires javascript in the address bar.

- Twitter: I'm currently using [semiphemeral](https://github.com/micahflee/semiphemeral) to delete old tweets.

From now on, I will be posting more often and, possibly, in two idiomas!

Keep tunned in for more info :)

Cristian
